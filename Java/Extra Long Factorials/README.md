Extra Long Factorials
=============

You are given an integer NN. Print the factorial of this number.

N!=N×(N−1)×(N−2)×⋯×3×2×1
N!=N×(N−1)×(N−2)×⋯×3×2×1
Input 
Input consists of a single integer NN, where 1≤N≤1001≤N≤100.

Output 
Print the factorial of NN.

Example 
For an input of 2525, you would print 1551121004333098598400000015511210043330985984000000.

Note: Factorials of N>20N>20 can't be stored even in a 64−bit64−bit long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.
